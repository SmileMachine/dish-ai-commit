## ðŸ›  Purpose of This File

This `OWNERSHIP.md` file is created to support my claim for the `littleCareless` namespace ownership on **Openâ€¯VSX**. It confirms:

1. **I am the genuine developer and publisher** associated with this editor extension.
2. **I control both the GitHub repository and the VSÂ Code Marketplace listing**, which is verified under my personal account.
3. **This file's existence acts as tangible evidence**, reducing the need for further verification steps.

Please consider this documentation as auxiliary proof in conjunction with:
- An issue submitted to `EclipseFdn/open-vsx.org` to **claim namespace**.
- Full control of the Marketplace listing and source repo.

Thank you for reviewing this ownership documentation, which I hope will expedite the namespace verification process.
