### Example 1: Python Backend Service Code Review

\`\`\`
# Code Review Report

## Overall Assessment
- Quality Score: 72/100
- Risk Level: Medium
- Technical Debt: 2.5 person-days

## Issue List
1. [Architectural Design] - [Severity: Medium] 
   - File: app/services/user_service.py
   - Line Numbers: 45-78
   - Issue: Business logic mixed with data access logic, violating Single Responsibility Principle
   - Impact: Reduced code maintainability, increased testing difficulty
   - Suggestion: Extract data access logic into a dedicated DAO layer

2. [Security Vulnerability] - [Severity: High]
   - File: app/api/endpoints/users.py
   - Line Numbers: 32-36
   - Issue: User input directly used in SQL queries, creating SQL injection risk
   - Impact: Attackers may execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to data leakage or corruption
   - Suggestion: Use parameterized queries or ORM framework's secure query methods

3. [Performance Issue] - [Severity: Medium]
   - File: app/services/report_service.py
   - Line Numbers: 156-189
   - Issue: Database queries executed inside loops, causing N+1 query problem
   - Impact: Performance degradation and timeouts when generating large reports
   - Suggestion: Implement batch queries or use JOIN statements to fetch required data in one go

## Highlights
- Input validation decorator in app/utils/validation.py is elegantly designed, increasing code reusability
- Exception handling mechanism is uniform and comprehensive, helping reduce unhandled exceptions
- Test coverage reaches 85%, reflecting good testing practices

## Improvement Roadmap
1. Short-term Improvements (Current Iteration)
   - Fix identified SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Resolve N+1 query problems
   - Add missing input validation

2. Long-term Optimizations (Future Iterations)
   - Refactor service layer to separate business logic from data access
   - Introduce caching mechanism to improve performance for frequently accessed data
   - Implement unified logging and monitoring strategy

## Security Assessment
- SQL Injection vulnerability (OWASP Top 10: A1-Injection)
- Lack of proper input validation (OWASP Top 10: A7-Cross-Site Scripting)
- Recommended to implement parameterized queries and comprehensive input validation strategy

## Performance Analysis
- Report generation feature has database query efficiency issues, current response time exceeds 3 seconds
- Optimizing batch queries is expected to reduce query time by 70%
- Consider implementing on-demand loading or pagination mechanisms for report data

### Example 2: JavaScript Frontend Code Review

\`\`\`
# Code Review Report

## Overall Assessment
- Quality Score: 68/100
- Risk Level: Medium
- Technical Debt: 3 person-days

## Issue List
1. [State Management] - [Severity: High]
   - File: src/components/UserDashboard.jsx
   - Line Numbers: 25-108
   - Issue: Component internal state is overly complex, lacking proper separation
   - Impact: Difficult to maintain and test, inefficient component re-rendering
   - Suggestion: Use Redux or Context API to separate state logic

2. [Performance Optimization] - [Severity: Medium]
   - File: src/utils/dataProcessor.js
   - Line Numbers: 45-67
   - Issue: Large dataset processing not optimized, causing UI blocking
   - Impact: Degraded user experience, noticeable operation delays
   - Suggestion: Implement data chunking or use Web Workers

3. [Security Risk] - [Severity: High]
   - File: src/services/api.js
   - Line Numbers: 12-18
   - Issue: API credentials hardcoded in frontend code
   - Impact: Credentials easily extractable, leading to unauthorized access
   - Suggestion: Migrate to secure backend authentication mechanism

## Highlights
- High component reusability with appropriate abstraction levels
- Consistent code style following modern JavaScript best practices
- Comprehensive error boundary handling improving application stability

## Improvement Roadmap
1. Short-term Improvements (Current Iteration)
   - Remove hardcoded API credentials
   - Implement chunking mechanism for large data processing
   - Fix identified memory leaks

2. Long-term Optimizations (Future Iterations)
   - Refactor state management system
   - Introduce code splitting and lazy loading for performance improvements
   - Establish end-to-end testing framework

## Security Assessment
- Client-side storage of sensitive information (OWASP Top 10: A3-Sensitive Data Exposure)
- Lack of CSP configuration (OWASP Top 10: A7-XSS)
- Recommended to implement Content Security Policy and secure authentication flows

## Performance Analysis
- First load is too slow (FCP > 2.5s)
- Large list rendering causes framerate drops (<30fps)
- Optimization expected to improve initial loading speed by 40%, scrolling performance by 60%
